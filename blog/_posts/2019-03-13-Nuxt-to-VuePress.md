# Switching from Nuxt to VuePress

After putting off writing anything, I decided to have another look at creating a blog for myself. I started by looking at what Mattt from [NSHipster](http://www.nshipster.com) was doing with jekyll and I discovered front matter. Nuxt did not have support for this out of the box and I happened to come across VuePress and noticed that it had the metadata support that I wanted and you can still make calls from vue inside your markdown if you wanted to.
